# opencv-android-edge-detection

Android real time image processing project using OpenCV Library.

In this project, we catch the smartphone camera image, convert to gray scale, apply Gaussian Blur in order to facilitate the processing speed,
and finally we can apply Canny's Edge Detector algorithm.

Through the native Android SeekBar, it's possible to adjust the amount of both filters:
In Gaussian Blur, we can adjust the amount of Sigma in both axis, X and Y.
In Canny, we can adjust the amount of minimum and maximum threshold.
